      content="Personal finance management tool that helps track money exchanges between you and your friends. You can add as many friends as you like, and for each one, you can easily record whether they owe you money, you owe them, or if everything is settled. Using a simple form, you can enter the total amount and specify who cashed it, allowing the system to calculate the balance between you and each friend. This way, you always have a clear overview of your financial interactions with your friends."
